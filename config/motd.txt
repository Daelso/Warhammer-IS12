This is an atmospheric and immersive roleplay server in the dark setting of 40k. Set from the perspective of a Rogue Trader on a newly founded colony on the fringe of space. Outside of imperial borders and direct control, surrounded by aliens and heretics, and amongst the remains of a civilization born in the dark ages of humanity's distant past. You are to aid (or hinder) this expedition and it's attempts to bring order and exploitation, while dealing with factionalism and politics amongst the ever suspicious Inquisition, the zealots of the Ecclesiarchy, and the dogmatic Priests of the Machine Cult.

You currently reside on the ice world of Beroghast, bastioned within the noble frontier systems of the Eminent Domain. The fortress in recent months suffered catastrophe and the complete loss of life within the old castle. Those who have recently occupied it's walls now serve alongside their Lord Trader - sent by Holy Terra herself.
