Do not break the atmosphere.

Do not metagame.</strong>

<strong>This is an atmospheric and immersive roleplay server in the dark setting of Interstation 12-based universe. 
Set in alternate universe, 140-180 years after the IS12 Warfare and IS12 Reborn, you are doomed to exist under harsh conditions of the eternal winter, caused by atmospheric occlusion that occured due to global warfare and industrial progress centuries ago, that caused collapse of Redistan and reduced any trace of it's former glory to history. The place is a town of Eipharius, set at the Dominion of Alanii, authoritarian oligarchic state of industrials and scientists, led by technocratic Council of Founders. The area is sustained by Tesla Polarizers, utilizing incredible amounts of energy to contain habitable conditions of weather, keeping the cold out and pulling the warmth in. Polarizer network is being sustained by powerful power plant, fed on excavable fuel sources, such as coal and carbosyl - geothermally infused mix of hydrocarbons and sylicates, being composed into a mass of fuel-worthy chemicals. Eipharius is a local center of mining industry, forging, and thus, one of last hubs of the civilization amongst the Dominion of Alanii.
